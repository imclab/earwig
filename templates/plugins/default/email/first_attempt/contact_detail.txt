This is our first time contacting you through this particular email address ({{attempt.contact.value}}), so if anything looks amiss, feel free to log in to your account and edit your settings {{login_url}} or unsubscribe {{attempt.unsubscribe_url|safe}}. But remember that if you do that, people will probably just use information from our site to contact you directly throughout the day. As much as you would enjoy that, we're guessing daily digest emails are probably preferable. In order to enable them please sign up to claim your account.
