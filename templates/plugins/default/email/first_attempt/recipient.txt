Hello! Earwig is a project of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Sunlight Foundation designed to enable people to locate representatives at all levels of government and engage them in civil discourse through a single well-organized forum in a way that respects their time and preferences about when to engage and through what channels.

This project helps government officials like you respond to constituents efficiently, but more importantly, it can serve as a powerful buffer between them and your email inbox, office and cellular phone lines, and fax machines. Engage with them through Earwig, and everything will be super.
