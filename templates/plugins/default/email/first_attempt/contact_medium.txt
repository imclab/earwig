This is our first email contact with you. We obtained your email address from [somewhere], and you're welcome to claim your account and edit your email alert preferences {{login_url}} or unsubscribe from our emails entirely {{attempt.unsubscribe_url}}. But remember that if you do that, people will probably just use information from our site to contact you directly throughout the day. As much as you would enjoy that, we're guessing daily digest emails are probably preferable. In order to enable them please sign up to claim your account.
